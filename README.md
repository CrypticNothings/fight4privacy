Education is the key for protection. 

Idea of this is to be able to provide a link to this to educate people at risk.

One stop site to self-educate on all forms of attacks on privacy including phishing, scams, fraud, statistics, laws and more.


Once we lose...we lose it all forever. 
We lose the ability to fight back.
Let's not give up.

Here's some good song lyrics:
"If we don't take the action now
We settle for nothing later
Settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later"
-Rage Against the Machine

It's too easy to not care until it's too late to do anything and then say all the things "you could of done". Let's not be that way for this is far too important for our futures. 

I don't want this site to have a sign up/log-in or anything from the visitor. Don't build a site about privacy and build a contacts list. This is important. No "click to accept" pop ups. This is for educational purposes only and to arm the people with the most important weapon in this hidden battle: knowledge.
