# fight4privacy
Bring more awareness to all of what we are giving away.
Need to quickly spread the message about how quickly we are giving our rights to privacy away. 
We all do it....just click "I accept" so we get what we want...who cares right? Big deal.
Well...it's getting worse quicker and quicker. 
We aren't paying attention...and we are losing the fight.
Once it's too late...there's no going back...there's no "Oh, yeah...this is bad let's not do it like this anymore". 
Once we lose...we lose it all forever. 
We lose the ability to fight back.
Let's not give up.
Here's some good song lyrics:
"If we don't take the action now
We settle for nothing later
Settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later"
-Rage Against the Machine

It's too easy to not care until it's too late to do anything and then say all the things "you could of done".
