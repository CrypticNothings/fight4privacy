This is for us, the people who want the internet and our privacy. This is for us, to understand and learn what's happening.
This is for us, to act. 
Remember this when you decide to contribute. 
I'll allow just about anyone to contribute any way they want. I'm easy going and I want this to be for us...the people. 

So go for it. If I have a problem with it I'll talk to you why and we can decide TOGETHER what to do from there.

Let us not lose this.
