<div class="newspaper">The year between the June 2012 New York Times
publication detailing an alleged Western cyber operation
targeting Iran and the Guardian’s June 2013 publication
of the Snowden leaks marked a significant shift in the
international order. In these 12 months, the illusion of
the internet as an ungovernable information utopia was
shattered.
A less romantic vision took its place. Far from being
an anarchic asylum guided by nationless hackers and
idealistic entrepreneurs, the internet was revealed to be
a place where security services and intelligence agencies
had thoroughly penetrated, another arena for old international rivalries to play out. By the end of the summer of
2013, the world came to understand it was organs of state
power—with mundane monikers like Tailored Access
Operations and Unit 61398, not teenage super-hackers or
technology adept activists—who were the most powerful
actors in cyberspace.
Public denials and rebukes aside, undoubtedly many
foreign governments knew the broad outlines (at least) of
America’s activities in cyberspace prior to the summer
of 2012; however, the revelation of these activities to
their constituents caused a swell in domestic pressure
for leaders to address issues of privacy, sovereignty, and
the role of information technology as an instrument of
national power. What had been a niche national security
or counterintelligence concern (or opportunity for intelligence sharing) was now a mainstream political issue and
a matter of foreign policy. Cyberwarfare and computer
aided espionage had left the shadows and become an
overt tool of diplomacy and subject of public debate.

In his book The Hacked World Order, Council of
Foreign Relations chair Adam Segal explicates the
impact of these 12 months—what he refers to as “Year
Zero”—on the international order, and the role computer
network exploitation and cyber-operations have since
played in foreign policy. Beginning with “Year Zero,”
Segal creates a well-thought-out strategic map of cyberspace, contrasting the different perspectives, motivations,
and justifications of the various players. Throughout
his book, Segal pegs his analysis to established foreign
policy narratives: the rise of non-state actors, the decline
of American power vis-à-vis China, and the shifting of
economic and political centers of gravity to the Global
South. These familiar narratives will serve to help orient
readers new to cyberspace issues. They also suggest one
of the central themes of the book: conflicts in cyberspace
today are largely an extension of conflicts playing out in
traditional foreign policy arenas. The role of cyber power
has so far been limited in international conflicts, though
its importance is rapidly increasing and will continue to
be a source of significant strategic uncertainty.
Segal spends considerable time emphasizing the
unpredictability of cyber weapons. They may fail to
execute properly, spread to untargeted systems, or wreak
significantly more havoc than intended. Furthermore,
cyber weapons are difficult to use as a deterrent. As Segal
puts it: “You cannot march cyber weapons in a parade or
detonate them over a Pacific atoll.” (108) Finally, many
cyber weapons have a short shelf life as well as an erratic
development schedule, compared to traditional munitions. “Exploits,” the heart of most cyber weapons, can be
patched at any time and there is no guarantee that a newly
discovered exploit will have the same capability as one on
the shelf.
The strategic advantage presented by new cyber
weapons is often a “use-it-or-lose-it” proposition. All
these factors make applying traditional theories of use
of force difficult in cyberspace. They also make this a
particularly dangerous time—as norms for use of cyber
weapons continue to be established—for misunderstandings and unintended escalation. “Policymakers have lost
a sense of strategic stability, predictability, and control,”
Segal explains. (265) From Segal’s perspective, the
ongoing lobbying by the American private sector for legal
authority to retaliate against, or “hack-back,” intellectual

property thieves, state-sponsored or otherwise, will only
make this situation more precarious.
Because they pose significantly fewer risks for the
attacker than cyber weapons, psychological warfare
operations in cyberspace constitute a realm in which some
actors feel much more comfortable aggressively operating. The author cites Russia as a particularly aggressive
user of the internet as a medium for influence operations.
According to Segal, however, the Russians don’t believe
they started the information war: “Russian politicians and
military leaders see themselves as victims of information attacks from Western media, NGOs, and the internet
itself.” (81)
A weakened Russia, feeling threatened by NATO
encroachment and increasingly reliant on what it feels is
a Western-dominated internet may be fighting back the
only way it can. Russia’s well-publicized use of automated social-media posting (“bots”) and paid commenters
(“trolls”) is designed not to present a counter-narrative,
but to crowd out thoughtful conversation and spread confusion. Psychological warfare and influence operations
have been used against a wide variety of Russian rivals. A
coherent strategy on how to respond to these operations,
which don’t reach the threshold of armed conflict, has yet
to be established. These operations are integral to Russia’s
war-fighting strategy and have been used in conjunction with cyber weapons in its military campaigns in the
Ukraine and Georgia.
In addition to the military use of cyberspace, Segal
covers the ongoing conflict over the future of internet
governance. America’s position, logically and physically,
at the center of the internet has given it unique economic
and military advantages. International rivals like China
and Russia perceive that the motivating force behind
America’s efforts for a free and open internet is protecting
those advantages. Our adversaries counter the American
push to maintain an open internet with insistence that
cyber-sovereignty be respected. While acknowledging
the economic advantages of an open internet, China and
others view domestic stability as the higher priority. What
the United States sees as efforts to limit internet freedom
and restrict the flow of information, others view as
de-Americanizing it and claiming their cyber-sovereignty.
Segal posits that some Europeans, who would have been
sympathetic to US arguments, were dissuaded by the
Snowden revelations, interpreting our calls for internet
freedom—much like China and Russia—as the cynical
defense of a hegemonic status quo.
Despite some shortcomings (a distracting, inconsistent
style usage suggests the book could have used another
pass by the editor, and the assessments of US capabilities seem to be largely taken from news media analysis
of Greenwald-curated leaks), this is worthwhile read for
any intelligence officer looking for a primer on strategic
cyber issues. The information in this book will serve as a
solid foundation for regional- or target-specific research
and help put more focused information in perspective.
Approaching cyber from a foreign policy perspective with
a wide aperture makes this work accessible to a diverse
audience; both the technically inclined intelligence officer
and his better dressed colleague across the river will find
something useful here.
