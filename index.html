            <br />
            <br />
            <li>2010:</li>

        <li>USA Patriot Act 2001</li> 
            <ul>The USA PATRIOT Act, which stands for "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act," is a piece of legislation that was enacted in the United States in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001.

                The USA PATRIOT Act aimed to enhance law enforcement and intelligence agencies' capabilities to combat terrorism and protect national security. It introduced a wide range of provisions that expanded the government's surveillance and investigative powers, particularly in the following areas:
                
                Surveillance: The act allowed for increased surveillance of communication methods, including wiretaps, electronic communications, and the collection of business records.
                
                Searches: It expanded the authority of law enforcement to conduct searches, including "sneak-and-peek" searches, which allowed agents to search premises without immediately notifying the target.
                
                Information Sharing: The act promoted increased information sharing and cooperation among intelligence agencies and law enforcement.
                
                Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court: It expanded the authority of the FISA Court, a secret court that reviews and approves requests for surveillance and intelligence gathering related to national security.
                
                Money Laundering and Financial Investigations: The USA PATRIOT Act imposed stricter regulations and requirements on financial institutions to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
                
                Detention and Deportation: It allowed for the detention and deportation of non-U.S. citizens suspected of involvement in terrorist activities.
                
                The USA PATRIOT Act was a controversial piece of legislation. Supporters argued that it was necessary for national security and the prevention of terrorist attacks, while critics expressed concerns about potential violations of civil liberties and privacy rights. Some provisions of the act have been challenged and amended over the years, and there have been ongoing debates about the balance between security and individual freedoms.
                
                In the years following its enactment, several amendments and reauthorizations were made to the USA PATRIOT Act, with the most recent reauthorization known as the USA FREEDOM Act, which introduced some reforms to certain provisions.</ul>
        <li>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</li> 
            <ul>The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law that gives you the right to request access to records from any
                federal agency. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government.
                
                FOIA applies to all federal agencies, including the executive branch, independent agencies, and regulatory commissions.
                It does not apply to Congress, the courts, or state or local government agencies.
                
                Under FOIA, you can request any records from a federal agency, regardless of the format. This includes electronic
                records, such as emails, text messages, and social media posts. It also includes paper records, such as letters,
                reports, and photographs.
                
                FOIA requests are typically processed in a two-step process. First, the agency must determine whether the records you
                requested are subject to FOIA. If they are, the agency must then determine whether any of the nine FOIA exemptions
                apply. If an exemption applies, the agency may withhold the records.
                
                The nine FOIA exemptions protect a variety of interests, including national security, personal privacy, and trade
                secrets. However, the FOIA also includes a presumption of openness, meaning that agencies must disclose records unless
                they fall into one of the exemptions.
                
                If you are denied access to records under FOIA, you can appeal the agency's decision. You can also file a lawsuit in
                federal court to compel the agency to release the records.
                
                FOIA is a powerful tool for holding the government accountable and promoting transparency. It allows citizens to learn
                about how their government is working and to make informed decisions about their lives.
                
                FOIA is an essential tool for democracy. It allows citizens to hold their government accountable and to participate
                meaningfully in the democratic process.
            </ul>
        <li>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act</li>
            <ul>
                The Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) is a piece of legislation that incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights
                (ECHR) into domestic UK law. The ECHR is a treaty that sets out a number of fundamental rights and freedoms that are
                guaranteed to everyone in Europe.
                
                The HRA means that UK courts can now directly apply the rights and freedoms in the ECHR to cases before them. This has
                had a significant impact on UK law, as the courts have used the HRA to strike down legislation and government policies
                that they have found to be incompatible with the ECHR.
                
                The HRA also allows individuals to bring claims in the UK courts for violations of their human rights. This means that
                people can now seek redress for human rights abuses without having to go to the European Court of Human Rights in
                Strasbourg.
                
                The HRA has been used to protect a wide range of human rights, including the right to life, the right to liberty and
                security, the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom of expression, and the right to freedom of religion.

                The HRA is a landmark piece of legislation that has had a profound impact on the protection of human rights in the UK.
                It has made the UK a more just and equitable society, and it has given people a powerful tool to hold the government to
                account.
                
                Current status of the HRA
                The HRA is currently under threat. The UK government has proposed a number of reforms to the HRA, including making it
                more difficult for people to bring human rights claims and giving the government more power to disregard the rulings of
                the courts in human rights cases.
                
                These reforms have been criticized by human rights groups, who argue that they would weaken the protection of human
                rights in the UK. The reforms are currently being debated in Parliament, and it is not yet clear whether they will be
                passed into law.
